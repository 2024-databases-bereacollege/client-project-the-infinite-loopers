#Domain Names

##MEMBER

##Reflections & Changes
- Our previous version was missing a domain for each entity type. 
- We created a table for each entity type where we detailed the attribute name, description, and domain (type and size limit) for each attribute of the entity.
- We also identified all multivalued attributes among the attributes of each entity type, and restructured our E-R Diagram and Schema Design accordingly. 
- All spelling errors were also corrected.
